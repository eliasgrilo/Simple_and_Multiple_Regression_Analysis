# Simple_and_Multiple_Analysis
Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes that estimate the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, focusing on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Simple Regression Analysis: In simple (or univariate) regression analysis, we examine the relationship between two variables â€“ one dependent variable (Y) and one independent variable (X). The goal is to find a mathematical equation that describes the relationship, typically in the form of Y = a + bX + e, where 'a' is the Y-intercept, 'b' is the slope (showing the effect of X on Y), and 'e' is the error term.

Multiple Regression Analysis: In multiple (or multivariate) regression analysis, the relationship between one dependent variable (Y) and multiple independent variables (X1, X2, X3, ...Xn) is examined. The goal is still to find a mathematical equation that describes the relationship, but now it takes the form of Y = a + b1X
